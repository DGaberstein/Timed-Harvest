# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain `icon.png` - a 128x128 pixel image that represents your mod.

## Creating Your Icon

You can:
1. Create a custom icon using image editing software
2. Use a free icon from [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/)
3. Generate one using AI tools
4. Use a simple colored square as a placeholder

## Recommended Specifications

- **Size:** 128x128 pixels
- **Format:** PNG
- **Theme:** Something related to:
  - Clock/Timer (scheduled resets)
  - Pickaxe/Resources (resource worlds)
  - Harvest/Wheat (matches mod name)
  - Circular arrows (reset cycle)

## Temporary Solution

Until you have a proper icon, the mod will use Fabric's default icon. The mod will function perfectly fine without a custom icon.
